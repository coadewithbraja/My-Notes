What is difference between em,Rem,Px.
     ->Em:An Em is equal to the computed font-size of that elementâ€™s parent. For example,
          If there is a div element defined with font-size: 16px then for that div and for its children 1em = 16px.

      ->Rem:rem values are relative to the root html element, not to the parent element. 
               That is, If font-size of the root element is 16px then 1 rem = 16px for all elements.

      ->Px:Pixels are the easiest measurement to use. pixels may be good at spacing and layout but are not good fit for font-size.
